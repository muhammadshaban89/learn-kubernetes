Blue Green Deployment in K8s:
-----------------------------

* In Kubernetes, the Blue-Green deployment strategy involves running two identical environments—Blue (current) and Green (new) and switching traffic between them to minimize downtime and risk.

* Blue-Green deployment is a zero-downtime release strategy where:
 
- Blue is the live environment serving production traffic.

- Green is the new version deployed in parallel.

- Once validated, traffic is switched from Blue to Green.

This allows:

 - Safe rollbacks if issues arise.

 - Testing in production-like conditions before full release.

 - Minimal impact on users during upgrades.

How to Implement It in Kubernetes
---------------------------------

- Deploy Blue Version
- Your current stable app is running in a Deployment (e.g., blue-deployment) with a Service pointing to it.
- Deploy Green Version
- Create a new Deployment (e.g., green-deployment) with the updated app version.
- Ensure it’s isolated from production traffic initially.
- Smoke Test Green
- Run health checks, integration tests, or manual validation on the Green environment.
- Switch Traffic
- Update the Kubernetes Service selector to point to green-deployment pods.
- This reroutes all traffic to the new version instantly.
- Rollback (if needed)
- Simply re-point the Service back to blue-deployment.

 Best Practices:
------------------

- Use labels and selectors smartly to manage traffic routing.
- Automate with Helm, GitOps, or CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor metrics and logs during the switch.

Example:
-------

    kind: Deployment
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    metadata:
      name: mydeployments
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      selector:     
        matchLabels:
        app: apache
        ver: blue
    template:
     metadata:
       labels:
         app: apache
         ver: blue
     spec:
      containers:
        - name: webcon
          image: apache


- Consider using Ingress controllers or Service mesh (e.g., Istio) for more granular traffic control.
