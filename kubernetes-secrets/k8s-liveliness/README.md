üîç What Is a Liveness?
-----------------------

* In Kubernetes, a liveness probe checks whether a container is still running properly.
* If the probe fails, Kubernetes will automatically restart the container.

üîç What Is a Liveness Probe?
----------------------------

A liveness probe helps detect situations where a container is "alive" but stuck or unresponsive. For example:

‚Ä¢ Deadlocks

‚Ä¢ Infinite loops

‚Ä¢ Hung processes

If the liveness check fails repeatedly, Kubernetes kills and restarts the container to restore service availability.

Types of Liveness Probes:
------------------------

You can configure liveness probes using one of these methods:
 
* HTTP GET:  Sends an HTTP request to a specified endpoint 
* TCP Socket: Opens a TCP connection to a port.
* Exec Command: Runs a command inside the container.

Example:
-------
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        test: liveness
      name: mylivenessprobe
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: liveness
          image: ubuntu
          args:
          - /bin/sh
          - -c
          - touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 1000
          livenessProbe:                                          
            exec:
              command:                                         
              - cat                
              - /tmp/healthy
          initialDelaySeconds: 5          
          periodSeconds: 5                                 
          timeoutSeconds: 30 

- initialDelaySeconds: Wait time before starting probes.
- periodSeconds: Frequency of checks.
- failureThreshold: Number of failures before restart.

‚úÖ Best Practices:
-------------------
- Use different endpoints for liveness and readiness probes.
- Avoid expensive operations in probe handlers.
- Set appropriate timeouts and thresholds to avoid false positives.
- For long startup apps, consider using a startupProbe to delay liveness checks.
