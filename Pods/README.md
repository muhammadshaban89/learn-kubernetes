Whats is pod in K8S?
--------------------

In Kubernetes (K8s), a pod is the smallest and most basic deployable unit. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. You can think of it as a wrapper around one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storag

ðŸ§© Key Features of a Pod
-------------------------

â€¢ 	One or more containers: Most pods run a single container, but you can run multiple tightly coupled containers (e.g., sidecars).
â€¢ 	Shared resources:
â€¢ 	Network: All containers in a pod share the same IP address and port space.
â€¢ 	Volumes: Shared storage can be mounted across containers.
â€¢ 	Ephemeral by design: Pods are not meant to be long-lived. If a pod dies, Kubernetes can replace it via controllers like Deployments or ReplicaSets.

Real-World Analogy.
-------------------

Think of a pod like a shipping container:
â€¢ 	It holds your application (the container).
â€¢ 	It travels with its own network and storage.
â€¢ 	Kubernetes is the logistics system that deploys, tracks, and replaces these containers as needed.
