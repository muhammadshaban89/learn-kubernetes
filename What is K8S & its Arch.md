# ⭐ **What Is Kubernetes (K8s)?**
**Kubernetes is an open‑source, distributed system that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of machines.** 

But that sentence hides a *massive* architecture underneath.  

---

# 🧠 **High‑Level Architecture Overview**
A Kubernetes cluster is made of two major layers:

### **1. Control Plane (Master Layer)**  
The “brain” — makes decisions, stores cluster state, schedules workloads, and maintains desired state.  


### **2. Worker Nodes (Data Plane)**  
The “hands” — run your applications inside Pods.  


Together, they form a **Kubernetes Cluster** — a self‑healing, scalable, distributed system.

---

# 🏛️ **Kubernetes Control Plane — Full Deep Dive**
The control plane ensures the cluster always matches the **desired state** (what you declare in YAML).

It consists of **four core components**:

---

## 1️⃣ **kube‑apiserver — The Front Door of Kubernetes**
The **API Server** is the central communication hub.  
Everything — kubectl, controllers, nodes — talks to the cluster *only* through the API server.  


### Responsibilities:
- Validates all requests  
- Authenticates & authorizes users  
- Stores cluster state in etcd  
- Exposes REST/gRPC APIs  
- Provides watch streams for real‑time updates  

### Why it matters:
Without the API server, **nothing** in Kubernetes can communicate.

---

## 2️⃣ **etcd — The Cluster Database**
A **distributed, strongly consistent key‑value store**.  
It stores *everything* about your cluster: Pods, Deployments, Secrets, ConfigMaps, Nodes, Events.  


### Key properties:
- Highly available  
- Strong consistency (Raft algorithm)  
- Source of truth  

If it’s not in etcd, **it does not exist** in Kubernetes.

---

## 3️⃣ **kube‑scheduler — The Brain That Places Pods**
Watches for Pods with **no assigned node** and decides where to run them.  


### Scheduling decisions consider:
- CPU/memory requirements  
- Node resource availability  
- Affinity/anti‑affinity  
- Taints & tolerations  
- Data locality  
- Deadlines  

This is where Kubernetes becomes intelligent.

---

## 4️⃣ **kube‑controller‑manager — The Automation Engine**
Runs all controllers that maintain the cluster’s **desired state**.  


### Examples of controllers:
- **Node Controller** — detects node failures  
- **Replication Controller** — ensures correct number of Pods  
- **Endpoint Controller** — manages Service endpoints  
- **Job Controller** — manages Jobs  

Each controller is a loop that constantly checks:  
> “Is the actual state equal to the desired state?”  
If not → it fixes it.

---

# 🖥️ **Worker Node Architecture — Where Your Apps Run**
Each worker node runs three critical components:

---

## 1️⃣ **Container Runtime**
Responsible for running containers.  
Examples: **containerd**, **CRI‑O**, **Docker (deprecated)**  


### Responsibilities:
- Pull images  
- Start/stop containers  
- Manage container lifecycle  

---

## 2️⃣ **kubelet — The Node Agent**
Runs on every node.  
It ensures containers are running exactly as the API server instructs.  


### Responsibilities:
- Registers node with API server  
- Executes PodSpecs  
- Reports node & pod health  
- Manages container runtime  

If kubelet dies → the node becomes “NotReady”.

---

## 3️⃣ **kube‑proxy — The Networking Brain**
Maintains network rules on each node.  


### Responsibilities:
- Implements Service networking  
- Load balances traffic to Pods  
- Manages iptables/ipvs rules  

This is how Pods communicate inside and outside the cluster.

---

# 📦 **Kubernetes Workload Objects (Data Plane)**
These are not “architecture components” but essential to understanding how Kubernetes works.

### **Pod**  
Smallest deployable unit — contains one or more containers.

### **ReplicaSet**  
Ensures a specific number of Pods are running.

### **Deployment**  
Manages ReplicaSets → rolling updates, rollbacks.

### **DaemonSet**  
Runs one Pod per node (e.g., logging agents).

### **StatefulSet**  
For stateful apps → stable network identity & storage.

### **Job / CronJob**  
Run tasks once or on schedule.

---

# 🌐 **Cluster Networking Architecture**
Kubernetes networking has **four rules**:

1. Every Pod gets its own IP  
2. Pods can communicate without NAT  
3. Nodes can communicate with Pods  
4. Services provide stable virtual IPs  

kube‑proxy + CNI plugins (Calico, Flannel, Cilium) implement this.

---

# 🧩 **Add‑Ons (Optional but Common)**
Add‑ons extend cluster functionality.  
Examples:  
- DNS (CoreDNS)  
- Ingress Controller  
- Metrics Server  
- Dashboard  


---

# 🔄 **How Kubernetes Works Internally — Full Workflow**
Let’s walk through a real example:

### **You run:**  
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Step‑by‑step:
1. **kubectl → API Server**  
   Sends request to create Deployment.

2. **API Server → etcd**  
   Stores desired state.

3. **Deployment Controller**  
   Sees new Deployment → creates ReplicaSet.

4. **ReplicaSet Controller**  
   Creates Pods.

5. **Scheduler**  
   Assigns Pods to nodes.

6. **kubelet on each node**  
   Pulls images → starts containers.

7. **kube‑proxy**  
   Updates networking rules.

8. **Cluster reaches desired state**  
   Self‑healing begins.
